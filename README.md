# Social Media App that shows 3 pages - Feed list containing feeds posted by random users, each user details and comments posted by them.

Inorder to run the app - 
1. Download code from git or open in xcode 
2. Click on the click on cmd+r (Select whichever simulator you want to from the list )

Note -
Profile Image is not given in the api list, hence thumbnail placeholder is used.
Comments page is general one. Couldn't load comments based on post due to unavailability of api.
